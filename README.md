# Git Version Control

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is widely used for managing and tracking changes in collaborative projects.

## Benefits of using Git

1. **Versioning:**
   - Git allows for versioning, helping to track changes and revert to previous states if needed.
2. **Collaboration:**
   - Facilitates collaborative development with multiple contributors working on the same project.
3. **Branching:**
   - Supports branching, enabling developers to work on separate features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
4. **Distributed Development:**
   - Each developer has a local copy of the entire project, promoting decentralized and independent work.
5. **Speed and Efficiency:**
   - Git's design emphasizes speed and efficiency, making it a popular choice for version control.

## Git Tools

1. **Git Bash:**
   - Command-line interface for Git operations.
2. **Git GUI:**
   - Graphical User Interface for users who prefer visual interactions.
3. **GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket:**
   - Online platforms that host Git repositories and provide collaboration features.
4. **SourceTree:**
   - A Git GUI that simplifies Git operations with a user-friendly interface.

## Git Terminology

1. **Repository:**
   - A data structure that stores metadata for a set of files and directories.
2. **Commit:**
   - A snapshot of changes made to the repository.
3. **Branch:**
   - A parallel version of the repository, allowing for independent development.
4. **Merge:**
   - Combining changes from different branches.
5. **Pull Request:**
   - A proposed set of changes submitted by a user for review and merging.

## Basic Git Commands

1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
2. `git add`: Adds changes to the staging area.
3. `git commit`: Records changes in the repository.
4. `git status`: Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
5. `git log`: Displays a history of commits.

## Staging and Commit

- **Staging:**
  - The process of preparing changes for a commit by adding them to the staging area.
- **Commit:**
  - The act of saving staged changes to the Git repository.

## Inspect and Undo Changes

1. `git diff`: Shows the differences between working directory, staging area, and the last commit.
2. `git checkout`: Discards changes in the working directory.
3. `git reset`: Unstages changes in the staging area.
4. `git revert`: Creates a new commit that undoes specific changes.

## Collaborating

1. `git clone`: Creates a copy of a repository on the local machine.
2. `git pull`: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
3. `git push`: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.
4. **Branching for Collaboration:**
   - Creating feature branches to work on specific tasks independently.
5. **Pull Requests:**
   - Submitting and reviewing proposed changes before merging them into the main branch.
